            <img src="assets/images/acspicture.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Andrew Swartz">

            <p>My name is Andrew Swartz and I haved in Chicago for the past 3 years.
                Before that I lived in San Francisco and Houston Texas for about a year. I have spent the vast majority of
                my professional career in the Rail industry working for companies from leasing and terminal management to
                my current company which has a nationwide repair network. Outside of one year in operations I have spent
                the rest of the time in accounting and finance roles. I am a CPA with a Masters degree from St. Louis University
                and an Undergraduate degree from the Kansas State University (EMAW!!). </p>
